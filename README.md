## Information 
   LSB hiding technique hide the secret message directly in the least two significant bits in the image pixels, hence that affect the image resolution, which reduce the image quality and make the image easy to attack.
  This method can make the secret message more secure and enhance the quality of the image. The proposed method hides the secret message based on ***searching about the identical values between the secret messages and image pixels***.
